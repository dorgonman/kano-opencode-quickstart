# Decisions - Documentation Structure

- Created a new `README-opencode-portability.md` to provide a dedicated space for technical explanations and portability script documentation.
- Linked the new documentation from the existing `README-workspace-sync.md` to maintain discoverability while keeping the original document focused.
- Used English for the new documentation to match the codebase and technical depth, while keeping the link in Chinese to match the host document.
